      <description>An AI capable of successfully finishing a game of minesweeper
Logic is stored in the form of sentences, and the program uses a recursive algorithm to make inferences based on new knowledge obtained by clicking unexplored cells.
The bot does not always win as sometimes there are no safe cells to click, and at that point the bot will have to make a random move.

      <description>TicTacToe AI that uses a recursive minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move to make based on the best possible move their opponent (me) can play on the next turn.
Our algorithm also keeps track of who&amp;rsquo;s turn it is, all possible moves given the current state of the board, and whether or not someone has won the game.
