      <description>A static site I made for my blog using HTML, CSS, and Javascript that is hosted on S3 and utulizes Cloudfront.
Note: Though I know how to link a custom domain via Route53, I decided to save myself $12/year by not purchasing a custom domain.

      <title>React: Pomodoro Timer</title>
      <link>https://greent3.github.io/projects/creations/99_25&#43;5_clock/</link>

      <guid>https://greent3.github.io/projects/creations/99_25&#43;5_clock/</guid>
      <description>A timer with customizable parameters for work time and break time.
Implemented in 3 ways: as a single page stateful REACT app, a stateful app divided into parent &amp;amp; child classes, and an app made of functional components using hooks.
What Is the Pomodoro Technique? Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
Every time the clock runs out, the timer automatically resets and switches to work/break session.</description>
