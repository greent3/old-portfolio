      <description>Shields.io is a massive library of badges that can be inserted into project README&amp;rsquo;s or websites displaying various statuses (code coverage, health, version, etc).Â Support for docker was missing the current build health, and was a pretty trivial addition.</description>

      <description>A timer with customizable parameters for work time and break time.
Implemented in 3 ways: as a single page stateful REACT app, a stateful app divided into parent &amp;amp; child classes, and an app made of functional components using hooks.
What Is the Pomodoro Technique? Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.
Every time the clock runs out, the timer automatically resets and switches to work/break session.</description>
