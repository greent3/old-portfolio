Back-end of an online learning platform built using Python Django

Some features of the project:
- A content management system (CMS)
- model inheritance
- class based views and mixins
- formsets and model formsets
- groups and permissions

This project was completed as a tutorial outlined in Packt's Django 4 By Example, and is not my original work
