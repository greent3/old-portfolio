An AI capable of successfully finishing a game of minesweeper

Logic is stored in the form of sentences, and the program uses a recursive algorithm to make inferences based on new knowledge obtained by clicking unexplored cells. 

The bot does not always win as sometimes there are no safe cells to click, and at that point the bot will have to make a random move.

Completed as part of Harvard's AI programming with python course.
