A timer with customizable parameters for work time and break time.

Implemented in 3 ways: as a single page stateful REACT app, a stateful app divided into parent & child classes, and an app made of functional components using hooks.

What Is the Pomodoro Technique? Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks. These intervals are referred to as pomodoros.

Every time the clock runs out, the timer automatically resets and switches to work/break session.
