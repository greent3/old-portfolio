TicTacToe AI that uses a recursive minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move to make based on the best possible move their opponent (me) can play on the next turn.

Our algorithm also keeps track of who's turn it is, all possible moves given the current state of the board, and whether or not someone has won the game.
