### All other projects that either aren't 90+% my work, or aren't worth featuring on the front page of my portfolio

### Practice with Pytorch (tutorial):  
 - Using pytorch to hard-code weights and biases for a Neural Network that predicts whether a drug dose is effective.
 - Tutorial from StatQuest's "Intro to pytorch" video on youtube
 - Repo Link: https://github.com/greent3/Pytorch-Practice

### Django e-learning platform (Django tutorial):  
 - Backend of an e-learning platform built using Python Django (Courses, modules, instructors, students, etc.)
 - Features: content management system, model inheritance, class based views and mixins, formsets/model formsets, groups and permissions, dynamic content, caching (memcache & redis), callable RESTful API to interact with course data
 - Follow along tutorial using Packt's "Django by example" book
 - Repo Link: https://github.com/greent3/django-elearning-platform

### Django RESTful movie database API (Django tutorial + improvements):  
 - Completed Udemy tutorial for CRUD app. IMDB type app with RESTful API
 - Handles users, movies, reviews, etc.
 - Uses validators pagination, and throttling
 - I improved on the unit testing (views) to include testing for each level of user authentication
 - Repo Link: https://github.com/greent3/RESTful-movie-database-API


### Car Price Predictor (Python tutorial + improvements):  
 - Jupyter Notebook explaining the process of viewing, cleaning, and searching for correlations in car attributes/price data prior to encoding into a Random Forest Regression model to predict the price of cars based on their attributes such as engine volume, year, etc. Data provided by Kaggle.com
 - This same project can be found on Kaggle by Rakesh Jarupula. However, unlike Rakesh, I chose to use Z-score for outlier detection, and I added more comments to the code (esp. in Encoding and Model sections) to make the code more readable and to demonstrate understanding.

### Buildspace DAO starter (tutorial):  
 - Deploying ERC721(NFT) & ERC1155s(Fungible Tokens), Deploying ERC20, Airdropping tokens, Creating a treasury, Creating vote proposals, Granting & Revoking roles, Different modules required for a DAO (a contract for voting, a contract for tokens, a contract for NFT drop, etc.)
 - Completed tutorial (not my original work)
 - Repo Link: https://github.com/greent3/buildspace-dao-starter

### Watch out for Old Man Herbert! (Java University Project):  
 - A playable game completed as a university project
 - Video Demo Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1hPocLys3c

### C++ STL (Personal Project):  
 - I implemented my own Standard Library in C++ while studying algorithmic trading, market making, and high-performance C++ in Q1 2021.
 - I've since decided to focus on more creative endeavors (creating value as opposed to capturing value)

### Calculate my Poker Outs (Personal Java Project):  
 - Backend of a Java-based app I built in 2020 while quarantined in my dorm at university. 
 - Takes the poker table (hand and flop) and calculates which cards can improve you hand.
 - I never launched the app into production. It simply served as a fun project to improve my skills.
 - My programming skills have improved significantly since this project, and I therefore decided not to feature it on the homepage of my portfolio.
