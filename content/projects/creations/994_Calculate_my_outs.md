An 'out' is a card that you have yet to see and can improve your hand in Texas Hold'em. 
This app shuffles a deck, gives every player at the table a hand of 2 cards, deals a flop, and then uses the cards in the flop and your hand to determine which cards are necessary to increase the value of your hand. 

#### Note: I wrote this program while quarantined in my dorm at University. However, this was prior to my discovery of BOB Martins SOLID principles and other common coding standards like DRY, so my code is a bit long and ugly.
However, it served as a way for me to practice OOP and I would not be where I am today had I not practiced :)


Today, I try to keep my functions as short as possible (esp main), and, when practical, structure functions to be reusable.
