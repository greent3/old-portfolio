With SQL queries, we're able to answer questions like:
 - Do graduate degree holders use caffeine more often than less educated people?
 - Which illegal drugs are becoming more popular over the decades?
 - Are less educated people more likely to lie about (overreport) drug usage?
 - Do senior citizens smoke & drink less than young adults?
