TL;DR
1. We humans react not to events, but rather our judgement about said events. Change your judgements to change your world.
2. Focus only on what you can control. Awareness and rational preparation have value to the future at low cost to the present, but worrying about what one can not know or control of the future has no value to either, and comes at the cost of the present
3. It's human nature to compare yourself against those more fortunate. However, if you only do relative comparisons with those less fortunate than you, and your ambitions will be fueled by gratitude rather than anger/envy.
