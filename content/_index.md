#### Backend developer, ML enthusiast, and expert communicator with years of leadership experience.  

\
Are you looking for someone who can hop between server-side development and machine learning?  
Perhaps someone with a track record of academic success, accountability, and strong interpersonal skills?  

Strongest in Python, I love the art of turning code into a readable, reusable piece of art.  
I'm also strong in C++, and have dabbled in Java, React, and Solidity.  


In my free time, I like to read educational books, speculate in equities, and binge Korean Dramas.

 "It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on a cold freezing night, and he is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, 'When you give me some heat, then Iâ€™ll put some wood in.' &nbsp;  
  When it comes to life and business, all one needs to remember is first to give what you want and it will come back to you in droves." -Robert Kiyosaki
