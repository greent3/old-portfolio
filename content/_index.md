#### Software Engineer with years of leadership and communication experience  

\
Strongest in Python, I love the art of turning code into a readable, reusable piece of art.  
I'm also strong in C++, have done coursework in Java, React, Solidity, and am a Certified AWS Cloud Practitioner.  

In my free time, I like to read educational books, speculate in equities, and binge Korean Dramas.

 "It reminds me of the story of the guy sitting with firewood in his arms on a cold freezing night, and he is yelling at the pot-bellied stove, 'When you give me some heat, then Iâ€™ll put some wood in.' &nbsp;  
  When it comes to life and business, all one needs to remember is first to give what you want, and it will come back to you in droves." -Robert Kiyosaki
